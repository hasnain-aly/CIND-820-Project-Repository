# Profit Prediction of Fortune 1000 companies by Revenue 2022

### Project Description
Each year Fortune Magazine publishes a list of companies with highest revenues in the United States, it’s called “Fortune 1000”.
 According to the Fortune magazine’s website, the top 500 companies out of 1000 generated $16.1 trillion in revenues and $1.8 trillion in profits for the year 2021.
 Therefore, naturally any news on these companies attracts a wide range of audience.
 From an individual to a large corporation, a lot of decisions are made everyday based on the rankings of these companies. Whether it’s a potential employee, a supplier, or an investor, the rankings affect all its stakeholders.
 For the company itself, it’s a badge of honor to be included in the Fortune 1000 list.
 
 This list assumes revenue as the key figure and therefore ranks the companies based on the highest revenue earned in the financial year. But the reality is, 
 not every company gets to keep all that money earned. It gives away a large portion of it in expenses, interests, taxes etc and sometimes it has to give all of it that incurs a loss. 
 But if saved enough for itself, that's profit for the year.
 
 This project argues that these companies should not be ranked as per the highest revenue earned but rather how much profit they made. Making profit the key figure instead of revenue.
 With that in mind, this project predicts the profit for the Fortune 1000 companies using machine learning making it a supervised learning regression problem.
 
 Programming languange used in this project is Python and the platform is Jupyter. The dataset used can be accessed on Kaggle

 ### Stages of the Project
 
 The project goes through the following stages:
 
 1. Initial Analysis
 2. Exploratory Analysis
 3. Feature Reduction
 4. Experimental Design
 5. Modeling
 6. Evaluation
 7. Improving the Model
 8. Conclusions
 
 ### Brief Description of the Project Stages
 
 #### Initial Analysis: 
Before the initial analysis was carried out, the dataset went through some cleaning and modification. Special characters were removed, attributes renamed, null values removed, and data dictionary was made. 
To better understand the data attributes a detailed Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis was performed.

 #### Exploratory Analysis: 
During this stage, an EDA was performed to go one step further to develop a better understanding of the dataset.

 #### Feature Reduction: 
At this stage, some new features were added which were removed. In addition to that some of the default features which had no significance were also deleted from the dataset for better modeling.

 #### Experimental Design:
 The splitting of the dataset was done at 70/30 for all models used.
 
 #### Modeling:
 Four regression models were used in this project. 
 1) Linear Regression
 2) Random Forest Regressor
 3) Decision Tree Regressor
 4) Support Vector Machine Regressor
 
 #### Evaluation:
 For evaluation, the cross validation is used for all four models. In addition to this, other measures like RMSE, R2 Square, MAE, and MSE are also used for evaluation.
 
 #### Improving the Model:
 As this is the initial code and result phase therefore this yet has to be completed for next deliverable
 
 #### Conclusions
 Next deliverable
